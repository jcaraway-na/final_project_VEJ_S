                                            increase in Austin's population. This, coupled with the fact that the patterns of
                                            crashes
                                            remained the same, suggests that the
                                            best way to decrease crashes is to simply have fewer cars on the road. COVID did not
                                            affect
                                            when
                                            people crash, but just decreased
                                            their likelihood by keeping former commuters at home. The only question that remains is
                                            why,
                                            if
                                            crashes overall are still down, and crashes
                                            involving pedestrians are down, why are serious crashes back up to pre-pandemic levels?
                                            It
                                            could
                                            be the result of reckless driving
                                            caused by stress, or that people who are primarily working from home are worse at
                                            driving
                                            than
                                            before.

                                            there's a precipitous drop in early 2020, when, despite more people living in Austin, fewer

                                    in the two time periods, show a huge decrease in traffic incidents. Because the overall pattern
                                    of crashes did not change, and because crashes decreased despite population growth, the most
                                    likely explanation is that the increase in remote work during the COVID pandemic simply reduced
                                    the number of people on the roads -- and thus the number of people hurt on the roads.
