                    Selected Topic:
                    If the covid pandemic did not happen, how would traffic incidents compare to current traffic
                    incidents since the pandemic began?
                    Reason why we selected the topic:
                    We selected this topic to analyze traffic trends throughout the Central Texas area.
                    Description of the source data:
                    Vision Zero Crash data is obtained from the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) Crash Record
                    Information System (CRIS) database, which is populated by reports submitted by Texas Peace Officers
                    throughout the state, including Austin Police Department (APD), and maintained by TXDOT.
                    Questions we hope to answer with the data:
                    If the covid pandemic did not happen, what would traffic incidents look like through the current
                    date?
                    Since the covid pandemic happened, are commuters more or less safe/better or worse drivers?

                        Interestingly, crashes involving pedestrians continued to stay low in 2021 in contrast. After a
                        dip in early 2020, the
                        actual crashes involving pedestrians did not reach the model's prediction at any point in 2020

                        Looking at crashes by the day of the week and the hour shows that, while crashes were down
                        during the COVID pandemic,
                        traffic patterns remained the same. During COVID, crashes increased throughout the week, peaking
                        on Fridays and Saturdays, and then decreasing again on Sunday -- which is the same pattern found
                        in pre-COVID data, even
                        though COVID crashes were much less overall. Similarly, evening rush hour (5-7 pm) was the most
                        dangerous
                        time to drive both before and during COVID, despite a decrease across the board in number of
                        crashes.

                                The average number of all crashes per month in 2013-2019 far surpassed crashes in 2020
                                or
                                2021.
                                You can see
                                a sharp drop in March of 2020, and throughout the next two years as many are working
                                remotely,
                                crashes remain lower despite an
                                increase in Austin's population. This, coupled with the fact that the patterns of
                                crashes
                                remained the same, suggests that the
                                best way to decrease crashes is to simply have fewer cars on the road. COVID did not
                                affect
                                when
                                people crash, but just decreased
                                their likelihood by keeping former commuters at home. The only question that remains is
                                why,
                                if
                                crashes overall are still down, and crashes
                                involving pedestrians are down, why are serious crashes back up to pre-pandemic levels?
                                It
                                could
                                be the result of reckless driving
                                caused by stress, or that people who are primarily working from home are worse at
                                driving
                                than
                                before.

                                Even controlling for the population of Austin, which continued to grow during the COVID
                                pandemic, crashes were much lower during 2020. In the graph of accidents per capita per month,
                                there's a precipitous drop in early 2020, when, despite more people living in Austin, fewer
                                people were crashing in Austin.

                        likely explanation is that the increase in remote work during the COVID pandemic simply reduced
